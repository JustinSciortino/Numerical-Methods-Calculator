Description:

Welcome to the ENGR391-Numerical Methods project repository. This repository is dedicated to providing Python
implementations of numerical methods to solve problems related to the ENGR 391 class. It is designed to aid your
understanding of numerical techniques, but it comes with certain guidelines to ensure ethical usage.


Important Note: Code Sharing Restrictions:

The Python code contained within this repository is intended solely for personal educational purposes. It should not be
shared publicly, especially with individuals who are currently enrolled in the ENGR 391 course. Sharing these code
solutions, particularly for assignments, midterms, and finals, could lead to academic integrity violations and
negatively impact the learning experience of others.


Usage Disclaimer:

While this repository prohibits the use of its code for assignments, midterms, and finals, it's important to clarify
that the professor does not actively monitor or enforce this restriction. It is the responsibility of users to
abide by the academic integrity policies of their institution and to use external resources responsibly and ethically.


Project Structure:

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each corresponding to a lesson in the ENGR 391 class. These folders
are labeled as "Lesson1" through "Lesson8," representing the sequence of lessons in the course. Within each folder, you
will find Python programs that implement various numerical methods discussed in the respective lesson.


Disclaimer:

This repository aims to enhance understanding of numerical methods through practical implementations. However, the
maintainers and contributors are not liable for any consequences that arise from the misuse or inappropriate sharing
of code from this repository. Users are expected to exercise discretion and integrity when using the code in their
coursework.
